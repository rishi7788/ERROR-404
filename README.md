# Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/username/404-page.git

2. Integrate into Your Website

 
Option 1: Static Site
If you're using a static site, simply upload the 404.html file to your website’s root directory. Most static web hosts will automatically serve this file when a 404 error occurs.

Option 2: Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
For web servers like Apache or Nginx, you'll need to configure the server to use the 404.html page when a page is not found. Here's how:

Apache: Add the following to your .htaccess file:

    ErrorDocument 404 /404.html
Nginx: Add this to your nginx.conf:

    Error_page 404 /404.html;
    location = /404.html 
    {
    root /path/to/your/html/files;
    internal;
    }
    
3. Customize the Page
Open the 404.html file in any text editor to modify the page content, style, or behavior. You can update:

* Text: Change the error message to suit your style.
* Images: Replace the background or icons as needed.
* CSS: Update styles in the style.css to match your website’s branding.
* JavaScript: Add custom scripts for animations, redirection, etc.
# Usage
To use this 404 page, make sure the 404.html is linked in your web server configuration (as shown above). Once set up, visitors who land on a non-existent page will see your custom 404 page.
